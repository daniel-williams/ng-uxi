Introduction																														
"Hi!  This test will focus on trying a few lightweight tasks using the Edge web browser.  We will test it on a remote PC, but try to ignore that aspect of it.

During each task, please focus on the task itself and do not multitask unless asked.    You do not need to talk aloud as you work, there will be several questions and a chance to give feedback at the end of each task. 

This test should take around 20 minutes.

We want to better understand what your experience with Edge is like, so please be honest and forthcoming with your feedback. Thank you!"																														
																														
Task 1																														
"First thing is to get connected to the remote PC.  There are a few steps:

1. A website will open, asking for the project name.  Enter ""JuneBrowser"" and press ""Submit.""

2. A remote desktop file with a name similar to ""CUE-Browser00_...rdp"" will download.  Open or Run this file. It should launch in Remote Desktop Connection (built into Windows 10.)

3. You will be prompted to accept an 'unknown connection' to the remote PC.  Don't worry, this is a one-way connection that won't affect your home PC at all. 

4. When prompted to login, use this password: CUEpassword1


Click 'Next' once you are connected and signed in (the background should be a blue Windows logo.)"																														
																														
Task 2																														
"Now that you are logged into the remote PC, go ahead and open up the Edge web browser.

(Edge is the blue 'e' icon in the taskbar.)"																														
																														
Task 3																														
"Task 1 of 8: Visit a lasagna recipe site from your Favorites.

If you have any difficulty seeing or clicking things in the browser, try clicking the 'pin' icon on the blue toolbar to hide it, or move this instruction window to see what's behind it."																														
																														
"Task 4 [Multiple Choice: Yes, No, I'm not sure.]"																														
Were you able to successfully visit the site about lasagna?																														
																														
"Task 5 [Multiple Choice: Much longer than I expected, Somewhat longer than I expected, About as I expected, Somewhat faster than I expected, Much faster than I expected]"																														
The time it took to visit a favorite site was...																														
																														
Task 6 [Rating Scale: Strongly disagree to Strongly agree]																														
"Please rate to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statements:

That's it for tasks!  Click on the 'x' in the remote desktop app (near the top of your screen) to close your connection and we'll wrap up with just a few more general questions.																														
																														
																														
Post-Test Questionnaire																														
Question 1																														
"Based on your experience today, how likely are you to recommend this browser to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?"	9. It worked the same as other browsers but did seem to load faster.	6	"10 - new and interesting browsing, willing to try it out"	9	5	10	8/9	10	I would give this an 8	7	7	9	7	10	7	2	6	7	5	9	9. It is similar to Chrome so I think that a Chrome user would find it acceptable	9	10	8	3	5	8	7	7	7
																														
Question 2																														
Please tell us a bit about how this session went... (too few or too many questions?  too simple or too complex?  etc.)	Too many repetative questions. Maybe a few more tasks with less questions of the same nature.	"There were a lot of questions, but it was all very simple and direct. Easy to follow the instructions and tasks were completed quickly."	"Very easy, nothing too complex"	Redundant questions so I'd say a bit too many.	"There were a lot of questions.  I didn't like that I couldn't come up with my own words, that you wanted me to select from your list - felt it was extremely repetitive"	"All of the questions were very repetitive, which was a little frustrating because of the amount of them that there were. But I thought it was really easy to get through them all and it wasn't too complicated!"	"The session went fine! I thought that the amount of questions was just right, and it was a little simple for me, but I'm more of a tech guru than most people, so I think it's probably the right level of complexity for the average person."	"very good, it went fast was pretty easy. I enjoyed it"	I think the question amount was perfect. They weren't describing questions and you didn't need to speak during the test. These questions were quick and simple; all you had to do was selct what you felt. Having more questions is nicer  because the feedback given is richer and more meaningfula and covers a wider range of areas compared to if you just have a few and get vague feedback.	"At first I thought there were too many ""steps"" to the procedure. Most tests have 10-30. 86 was a little unusual, but I realized you really prepared only 8 tasks with some multiple choice questions. That said, it did take me longer than expected to complete the test. Some of the tasks were too vague and I still do not know if there was some functionality that you implemented that I had to notice and use. So try saying something like ""Find the fucntion of changing the opened tabs order"" if there is some sort of new feature. I would also advice you to shorten the amount of ""steps"", because it may scare some poeple off."	I think that the session went very well. I feel that I had a good understanding of how browsers work and so many of the questions were very easy for me. I do know a few people who would have difficulty understanding the questions. I would say that the questions are good for most people. There were also a good number of questions. The test took about 20 minutes for me to complete.	It was a lot of questions but very easy to do	"Most tasks where very easy, in a good way. There were a lot of quetsions to get through."	This test was easy to complete. The only thing i would say is I needed more than 20 minutes. You could bundle alot of what you want to know easily to help the test not be so extensive. The test is not that long but it would be helpful to bundle a few tasks.	"Very simple and straightforward, overall. I was able to complete all of the tasks, though there may have been more simple ways to sort tabs and to add a new favorite to a folder."	This session was perfect. Enough quesitons (maybe a little too many) but the instructions were clear and easy to perform for someone with a technological background	"It was good, just enough tasks 
simple indeed"	"There were a lot of questions, but it went smoothly."	"Too many questions, quite repetitive. All had similar answers, because on similar operations."	"the session was easy and not hard at all, I learned a few things that i wouldnt normally do on a browswer so thats a plus. The questions were just right and not to many at all"	I think that there were alot of repetative types of  questions but I guess that has to do with making sure you get the right data that is not biased. But other thatn that it was fine.	"It went well. It felt too simple, but I am an advanced user who uses a computer everyday. The browser is familiar too so it was confusing at all"	"This session for me did not go as I would have liked. At first I thought it was very complicated, then I thought there was a problem with the task box moving. The error was mine and once I was able to move the task box the rest of the session went fairly smooth. The questions were fine. The tasks were fairly simple."	"I think a couple of the questions were a bit redundant, but the session went well."	It was generally easy. There were a couple tasks that I was not sure how to complete only because I've never done them before. But I was able to complete all tasks regardless of my familiarity with the tasks at hand.	It was fine- number of questions and clarity were acceptable.	"The session was decent. It didn't have too many questions, but it was a bit redundant."	It was rather simple. The amount of questions was decent but I was hoping that I might learn something a little more complicated about the edge browser that might sway me to switch.	too many questions! but I enjoyed it!	"There were a bit too many repetetive questions and the tasks were very easy to complete. The questions could be a bit more specific and should allow to express my thoughts about the browser. On the other hand, the questions were very straight forward which is mostly nice."
