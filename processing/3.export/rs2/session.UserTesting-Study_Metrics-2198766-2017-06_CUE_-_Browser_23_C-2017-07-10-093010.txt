That's it for tasks!  Click on the 'x' in the remote desktop app (near the top of your screen) to close your connection and we'll wrap up with just a few more general questions.																														
																														
																														
Post-Test Questionnaire																														
Question 1																														
"Based on your experience today, how likely are you to recommend this browser to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?"	7 all browsers seem to work very  similiarly	10	9	5	"10, very likely.  Chrome does seem like a great browser.  Overall I was very impressed with how fast it brought back options for what I was searching for as well as the webpage I needed.  I do think that anyone would be happy to use this as their browser.  Overall I feel like I can trust chrome to help me find what I am looking for as well as help me with everyday things like the weather and news."	"1 It worked very similar to browsers I currently use, I didn't see anything too outstanding"	10	9	9	10	10- I use Google Chrome and so do most of my friends.	10	"10, This browser was very innovative and easy to use. I enjoyed how it has predictions before I finish searching for my query or webpage. I also enjoy the fact how it puts answers/results integrated into the search bar, such as weather for quick and easy search fro anyone on the run"	9 is my rating.	"10, As I mentioned, it is very simple and clean, but very strong in being able to do things in the address bar and with the quick tabs from frequently visited sites that are located in the middle of the page."	10	5	10	10. It's super fast	10	9	"On today's experience soley, 3. Based on past experiences, 8."	7	10	5	10	10	10	I'm very likely (10) because it has it's edges over other browser like search capability in the url bar itself. Search snippets and many more and other than that it's a web browser what preferably can go wrong nothing i guess.	7
																														
Question 2																														
Please tell us a bit about how this session went... (too few or too many questions?  too simple or too complex?  etc.)	"There were alot of repeative questions that seemed irrelevant. However it was smooth session that did have you repeat a few tasks with no real point to it, but over all was ok."	"I think there were a lot of questions, but structured in the same way each time so it was simple."	"too many questions, but it's ok. I dont mind"	"The questions were what I had anticipated. After a while, they do get redundant. I like how the taks forced me to do a slilghtly different task each time."	Overall I think this session went well.  There seemed to be enough questions and follow up questions for each task that was assigned.  It does seem simple to follow which is nice and would make for a great training for anyone that has not used chrome before.  I think each question asked had a purpose and helped retrieve the information needed.	It was simple and straightforward and the right amount of questions	Too many quesitons to click through. I think it would be easy to have a form with the questions and have a rating bar to select from for each task but overall it went well and was easy to understand what was expected from me.	Too many questions.. If there were different questions I would have like the test better.	"Maybe a little too many questions. Few questions could've been collaborated to make a single question. But the questions were fairly simple and to the point which made me answer them well. But yes, the number of questions were too many and at someplaces, I found it unnecessary, no offense meant. We can combine a few questions to make them one, in my opinion. Thank you."	The questions were all the same. I believe we could've just talked the answers instead of having to type them in. Also try and put other browsers with it so then I can better tell you if it's easier to use because then I'll have it right in front of me to look and see the difference.	"Too many similar questions in this session, but I did like the tasks."	"Good amount of questions, but too simple. The screener asked about my education level and work type, so I expected something a bit more advanced. Google Chrome is a standard tool, and it would be hard to go through grad school without experiencing a search engine."	"The questions should be more detailed such as ""search in the address bar above for _____"" as I was a bit confused in the beginning. Other then that the test was good overall."	I feel that there was a lot of questions that asked simliar things but overall it was quite simple and demostrated the browser's ability to obtain information quick and easy along with having a user friendly experience. There were some difficulties obtaining the answers i was looking for but overall the tasks showed me a very professional and innovative technology that seems to be changing the world around us. I felt that this task was a good fit.	"I don't feel that this was too complex, but the questions were a bit much.  I really was trying to keep the test to 20 minutes, but with 71 steps (7 tasks) it hard to go through it and yet be thorough with my responses."	"I found this session to be pretty interesting, there were not too many questions but some of the questions and tasks were a little repetitive but it did keep my interest and I found it to be interesting."	"I think there was just the right amount of questions.  They were simple, however, if I was able to pull up a website I would have been better able to rate the browser."	"The session was very simple. I was asked to rate the layout of the browser and then search for various information in it. The information was very easy to find, and I was able to find it as I expected. My overall impression of the browser is easy to use, reliable, and professional."	"it was very simplistic. I prefer being able to be more open ended with my assessments, but this test seemed to be more initial feelings on the product vs a deep dive of the nuances."	"I felt, there were a lot of questions which were very similar to other browsers. For example, ability to search with new tabs and most frequently used websites. Searching with the same tab also worked exactly the way I expected. What I noticed that was significantly different was the speed of the results and information provided while searching or in the google results. For example, As i was typing the weather, the weather immediately popped up with me having to press enter. This saves a lot of time."	Felt like I was runnig a circle with the tasks.  They were too similar.  It was a very easy session.	"Too repitive, I think they could have accomplished their study with half the amount of tasks since they were all the saem essentially."	too simple	"Many questions with similar tasks, but overall a good experience."	"A little too simple, and there were some typos with spelling on the questions, form instead of from for example."	lots of questions! it did take 18 minutes for me but seemed to go fast.	Perfectly pitched apart from one button which could not be found.	I think it went fine. I think there were more than enough questions to get to the fine workings of the Chrome web browser. It showed you how to work majority of it. And it also showed how quick the browser is which is great.	I would say it was kind of lengthy because asking the same question again and again like in the likert scales was a bit boring but i would say it's important too to get a good feedback about a product you are going to deliver to the end consumer. Other than that it was not at all complex and lastly if u can reduce some questions that would be great like keep it to 50-55.That's it thank you for the test.	Took much longer than 20 minutes. The UserTesting app started getting glitchy though but still functioned.
