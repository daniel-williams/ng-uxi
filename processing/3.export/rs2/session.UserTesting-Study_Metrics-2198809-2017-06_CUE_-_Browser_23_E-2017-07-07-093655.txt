Introduction																														
"Hi!  This test will focus on trying a few tasks using the Microsoft Edge web browser.  We will use Remote Desktop (an app built into Windows 10) to connect to and use another PC.  This will *not* affect your PC in any way.

During each task, please focus on the task itself and do not multitask unless asked.   You do not need to talk aloud as you work, there will be several questions and a chance to give feedback at the end of each task. 

This test will take around 20 minutes.

We want to better understand what your experience is like, so please be honest and forthcoming with your feedback. Thank you!"

That's it for tasks!  Click on the 'x' in the remote desktop app (near the top of your screen) to close your connection and we'll wrap up with just a few more general questions.																														
																														
																														
Post-Test Questionnaire																														
Question 1																														
"Based on your experience today, how likely are you to recommend this browser to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?"	"8. I would recommend and perhaps try this browser now,"	8	5	8	0	7	8	8	6		9	"About a 6. It is a good browser and everything loads quickly, which I think is probably its best selling point, but it also depends on what that friend or colleague wants out of his browser. Speed and reliability seem fantastic on Edge, but with Chrome, my experience is more customizable and depending on what the other person's needs are, perhaps that would create a better surfing environment."	9 - it was fast and efficient	7	7	10	10	6	6	10	7	9	5	4 or 5	9	8	8	10/very likely	10	8
																														
Question 2																														
Please tell us a bit about how this session went... (too few or too many questions?  too simple or too complex?  etc.)	"This task was very straight forward, I had no problems doing it. The number of questions did not seem to be too much and I finished within the estimated time."	too many questions that were very similar to each other	"The session went well, every task was easy to understand. 71 steps might seem menacing, but they are only small tasks."	"Simple enough, yet interesting to carry out."	"I'm not sure what the purpose of the remote desktop was - I think it slowed down the connection of the webbrowser, which may have made the product work less well than intended."	"to many questions that repeated themselfs, and testing of features that are expected of modern browsers, however the ablity to search for specific things without having to navigate to another search engine/website are useful."	Verry simple and straightforward	"The amount of questions was fine.  I didn't think the session was complex, though I was confused about starting.  I initially thought the Edge icon was going to be in the remote application and not my own, so I was a little slow to start.  Maybe emphasize it'll be in the users taskbar.  Also had a little trouble ending and getting to the remote app to close it."	I think it was easy and fairly straightforward.		"There were a lot of questions, but mostly repetitive, so it was easy to get through"	"There were a few more questions than I anticipated, which is not an issue for me, but it did take longer than the 20 minute expectation. I think in terms of completeness the large amount of questions are necessary, but a longer time estimate is probably more accurate."	"went great, I didn't have any problems"	A bit too many questions but they were easy so its ok. The tasks were great also.	It was a good session. The remote desktop made things a bit choppy but the length was fine and there were no major issues.	There were many questions but they were all easy to answer and did not take as much time as I expected.	I thought the session went well. The time passed quickly. I didn't realize I had been on it more than 20 minutes. I liked having multiple task to do. It was simple and easy to complete as the questions for predictable.	"Too many questions, too simple. I think that there were generalized questions for each task. If the questions were more task-specific they might have served more purpose. The task was relatively easy, but I dont think there is much need for it to be complex."	"I felt like the questions towards the end were a little reptitive in asking to test the same function, however it did show that i was getting used to the software as i was able to perform the tasks at a faster rate. I felt that this was not too simple nor too complex."	It was pretty simple and it went fairly fast once I understood the pattern to it - I was able to adjust my answers for each question based on the different tasks.	Questions and tasks were easy and straight forward.	A great session. A good amount of questions and some good tasks to test the website. I enjoyed the test.	"There were a bit many questions. They kept repeating. Some of the questions were not clear enough: The question that asked which words described the browser was not clear enough weather it wanted me to choose one word from the list or more words from the list. Also, another task didn't exactly specify if I should search on the website that I was actually on or if I should search a different website."	"It was good, but too many questions for a test."	This test had quite a number of questions and filling in and a not very long time frame to do so	"The amount of questions seemed to be just right, although it was a bit tough to finish in under 20 minutes, as you required typing out the answers instead of talking out loud as I am used to. However, the tasks seemed simple enough to complete without too much hassle."	"Seemed a little too simple, like it was made for a 10 year old or a very technology iliterate person. Asking very simple questions and not a huge variety of questions"	"It was easy and not complexed at all. The questions were average and was able to get what needed to be asked in order to get the answers it needed. The session as pretty fun to find different things and try to figure out how it works, to find it very useful and well put together. It was very creative after I started to fiddle with it."	the session went well. the questions were easy to answer and relevant to the software. I think that the tasks were simple and basic tasks and the wording was not complicated. I did not feel like you were asking me to do something different from what I assumed you were asking. there were a good number of questions though I found some of them to be repetitive.	"Just the right amount of questions, was very simple but I think that was probably what the test client had in mind, simply to assess the user experience with the browser."
