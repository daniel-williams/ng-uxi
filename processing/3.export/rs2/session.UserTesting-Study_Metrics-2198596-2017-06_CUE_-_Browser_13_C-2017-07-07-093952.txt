Introduction																														
"Hi!  This test will focus on trying a few lightweight tasks using the Chrome web browser.  We will test it on a remote PC, but try to ignore that aspect of it.

During each task, please focus on the task itself and do not multitask unless asked.    You do not need to talk aloud as you work, there will be several questions and a chance to give feedback at the end of each task. 

This test should take around 20 minutes.

We want to better understand what your experience with Chrome is like, so please be honest and forthcoming with your feedback. Thank you!"																														
																														
Task 1																														
"First thing is to get connected to the remote PC.  There are a few steps:

1. A website will open, asking for the project name.  Enter ""JuneBrowser"" and press ""Submit.""

2. A remote desktop file with a name similar to ""CUE-Browser00_...rdp"" will download.  Open or Run this file. It should launch in Remote Desktop Connection (built into Windows 10.)

3. You will be prompted to accept an 'unknown connection' to the remote PC.  Don't worry, this is a one-way connection that won't affect your home PC at all. 

4. When prompted to login, use this password: CUEpassword1


Click 'Next' once you are connected and signed in (the background should be a blue Windows logo.)"																														
																														
Task 2																														
"Now that you are logged into the remote PC, go ahead and open up the Chrome web browser.

(Chrome is the red, green, yellow and blue circle icon in the taskbar.)"																														
																														
Task 3																														
"Task 1 of 8: Visit a lasagna recipe site from your Bookmarks.

If you have any difficulty seeing or clicking things in the browser, try clicking the 'pin' icon on the blue toolbar to hide it, or move this instruction window to see what's behind it."																														
																														
"Task 4 [Multiple Choice: Yes, No, I'm not sure.]"																														
Were you able to successfully visit the site about lasagna?																														
																														
"Task 5 [Multiple Choice: Much longer than I expected, Somewhat longer than I expected, About as I expected, Somewhat faster than I expected, Much faster than I expected]"																														
The time it took to visit a bookmarked site was...

That's it for tasks!  Click on the 'x' in the remote desktop app (near the top of your screen) to close your connection and we'll wrap up with just a few more general questions.																														
																														
																														
Post-Test Questionnaire																														
Question 1																														
"Based on your experience today, how likely are you to recommend this browser to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?"	9	9	"10 Very Likely, I am going to try it for a while myself."	10	9.9	5	8	"I'm giving this a 5 because I don't know if it was me or the test but I was unable to locate the bookmarks on the screen.  If I was supposed to import my own into the test, I should have been given clear directions to do so."	"3, perhaps if they can't use Edge."	10	9	10	10	7	10	10 Worked great and intuitively	10	9	10	10	10	10	9	"9, Chrome is a good reliable browser"	7	10	9	10	10	9
																														
Question 2																														
Please tell us a bit about how this session went... (too few or too many questions?  too simple or too complex?  etc.)	"Honestly, there were a bit more steps involved that the usual webite review. However, the steps were not too complicated at all. It didn't make the revew too cumbersome at all to complete."	"The questions I felt were a little to simple and quite repetive. Some questions, like ""did the task go the way you expected it to"" were more helpful than others."	"The question where very simple and east to understand, they did repeat themselves alot which was a little boring however it kept the process simple and easy to understand so I didn't have to read every question over and over because there were the same for each task and that was convient. Tasked were something I use and it was nice to try a diffent system."	"I believe some of the tasks were too simple. A lot of the browsers people use are very similar so I would have liked to see a couple tasks based off more challenging things people do in their browsers, but still are not as simple to complete. Overall, I think the test went well and definitely enjoyed using this browser."	"somewhat many, but just cool."	The first task was diffcult to locate and after that everything was extremely simple.  Some tasks were so simple I wouldn't say it was worth the time to test it out they're so easy to do.	"I think the session went well.  Although the the bookmarking tasks were new to me, they were simple and for the most part well explained.  I have no criticism.  I'm a little surprised that there were not more complex tasks."	"The directions were confusing.  1)  I was directed by the test NOT to speak and I was directed by UT to KEEP speaking.  2)  Many of the questions pertained to Bookmarks.  I was unable to locate the Bookmarks file on the screen so I failed all of the questions having to do with Bookmarks. If I was supposed to import my own Bookmarks for this test, I should have been told to do so and given directions on how to accomplish this."	It was just right.	everything was pretty simple for me... Like I said in the feedback section I'm a millenial so I'm used to all the different types of web browsers. I really hope whoever has to watch this has a good day :)	"At first, the amount of questions was acceptable, but as the test went on I noticed that the questions seemed to be repeating themselves."	Amazing	When it comes to these types of tasks or reviews there are never too many questions. The questions were easy enough and the tasks were really good. I liked it a lot.	It was fairly simple. There were quite a bit of questions but they were easy to answer and complete in a reasonable amount of time.	It had a good number of questions with very clear directions which I loved.  I would like to see a test that goes more in depth to other functionalities of the browser as well.	"There were a lot of questions, however, very easy to answer and complete."	"It was very easy for me, but I m a student and use the computer a lot"	"It was overall easy, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to create the folder at first but once I did it was easy, and I appreciate that if i was unable to I could answer that I couldn't. I think the amount of questions and tasks was good.  Seeing that many steps made me a little nervous but they didn't take as long as I expected."	this session was much longer than i expected with a lot of questions. trying to give meaningful responses stretched out the time even further. i think i almost hit 40 minutes and that was a pretty long time to try to keep an open mind and complete tasks with a fresh outlook (although certainly not impossible).	I thought everything was very easy to use. It didn't feel like too many tasks. In fact the time went by very fast. Very easy to complete this test.	"Too many questions, but it was very easy to maneuver through the websites and the bookmarks and it did teach me a little more about the bookmarks."	I think this session was easy.	"There were a lot of questions, but it was fairly simple.  I did not mind the task."	"A lot of simple questions, very basic functions I knew how to complete"	It was just right the number of questions to get an over view of tasks we do on a daily bases	"Lots of repetition in the questions made for a less than fun experience to be honest, but I understand if you need consistent survey options across the board. Just a perspective as a user and a survey participant. The session had many more steps than I'm accustomed to, and even though that was new, I appreciate the thoroughness if you're developing some ways of improving the bookmark system (especially handling multiple tabs to open simultaneously)."	"The test was straight forward and the questions were clear.  Although there were a lot of steps, the questions were quick and easy to answer"	I think it was a great session. I think it was a good amount of questions to get a complete understanding of what I was experiencing.	"there were a decent number of questions, nothing was too hard but it wasnt too simple either. i believe the test was sufficient in attempting to understand the useablity of the crome browser for the tasks it did question. again my familiarity with similar options in the Edge browser made this session run smoothly for me."	Too many questions and too simple
