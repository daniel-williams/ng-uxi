Task 68																														
That's it for tasks!  Click on the 'x' in the remote desktop app (near the top of your screen) to close your connection and we'll wrap up with just a few more general questions.																														
																														
																														
Post-Test Questionnaire																														
Question 1																														
"Based on your experience today, how likely are you to recommend this browser to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?"	2	7	10	"0, answer would be different, I'm sure, had the remote desktop actually been functioning."	6	8	9	2	10	1	3	10	6	"5, I am more of a Google Chrome user, so I wouldn't recommend it, but it definitely was lower than 5 before today's test so that is a good sign of improvement"	7	10	7	9	10	9	5	6	5	8	5	7	9	9		10
																														
Question 2																														
Please tell us a bit about how this session went... (too few or too many questions?  too simple or too complex?  etc.)	way too many questions about the exact same types of steps.  it was redundant.  I was expecting to see some new feature or method to make browsing easier and this was basic internet 101.	too many questions and not very many complex questions.	"I thought the overall number was high, but not for the type of questions asked. I do think it is important that you let the tester know about how long the test should take. Which you did, had you not done that, I might have worried about length given 71 tasks"	"There were a lot of questions, but they were repetitive (asked same follow up questions) between each task so it wasn't as daunting. Unfortunately, as stated, the desktop wasn't functioning so I wasn't able to stop and give thought to each question pertaining to each task."	"The questions were okay, it was the experience that was rather dull."	"There was one point where I was confused whether I was supposed to search on the website I was on or using the address bar. If there was no search on that website, or if the search yeilded no results it would have been easier.The questions were a good way for me to express my thoughts without talking as much as I normally would in a test. They were a good way for me to share all the points that I wanted to get to."	"A lot of questions, but they went by pretty quick. Overall I thought the tasks were pretty simple and easy to do but I'm not sure that majority of people need to do anything beyound what you just had me do. And I think if you get those things right, which in my opinion you did, I think people will really want to use the browser."	"The questions were fine, please clairfy the question asking you to search for the Honda CR-Vso that they know to leave the current webpage and type in a search into the address bar itself."	A lot of questions but they were super quick	"I didn't care for the ""words to describe"" question. I would rather come up with my own terms - the ones provided seemed like focus group nonsense words that didn't really apply."	"I thought the first few questions were good, but the last few were asking me about things that I felt were neither specific to microsoft edge nor novel. For example I use chrome and search in new tabs, exisiting tabs etc. all the time. There really wasn't a difference between what I alwas do and what you asked me to do as far as I can tell. If there was then the test wasn't explicit enough for me to notice it. So I ended up answering a lot of questions like ""Yea, typing in a web address is important. I know. I do it a hundred times a day"""	"I think the session was fine.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to think out loud or not - there were no directions on speaking my thoughts.  Even though there were many questions, they were not complex, and I believe I was able to give my thoughts well without this session being too complicated."	It was pretty simple. The only task that was a little confusing is when it said to search from the current tab but I was on a different website without a search bar.	"too simple for me, since I am used to using google chrome all these functionalities were very familiar to me"	There were a perfect amount of questions but many of them were very simple. I wish there were more words on the list that I could have used to describe my experience.	"The session was very simple, but that was ok. I was able to predict the questions because they were very repetitious so maybe to reduce the amount of questions and make the test session less intimidating the questions could be reduced/combined."	The session went quickly and the questions were straight-forward. My one gripe would be that the descriptive words to be used as answers for some of the questions did not quite fit the kind of descriptors I would personally use.	I thought it was just fine.  At first I had a hard time opening the browser but once it loaded it was smooth sailing.  it really was very much like Chrome actually.	too simple	"the idea of not speaking as i preformed my task was a little unfamilair, but the questions were not hard at all. Some of the questions seems to be asking very similar things though, which seemed pretty redundent. overall i enjoyed the test though"	It was fine :)	"There was a delay with things and in the time of the delay it was difficult to determine if the browser was process my action, or didn't read my action.  It didn't feel like too many questions, but in order to answer them it took more than 20 minutes."	"I was worried about the number of questions at first, but overall I liked how the test was structured. I liked the scaled questions and long-form answers. I'm not sure if I was supposed to answer aloud as well, but the prompts did not indicate to do so (my apologies if I misunderstood). Overall, I enjoyed the test - job well done!"	"Questions asked were good and precise, they were uniform throughout each task. I liked that in asking to describe the site, words were given for me to choose from. Session went great and as expected in terms of length since that was also estimated for me."	"a lot of questions, the adjectives questions could have used radio boxes"	"very simple, a little disconcerting to download something to my computer. I almost dropped out for that reason, it would be nice to show more credentials to verify the safety of my computer. It seems like a lot of questions, but they go by really quick"	"The options given to express what you felt about each activity were a bit restricted and did not grasp a full range. There are more aspects that could be adressed, for example the browser icon, since it reminds me of Internet Explorer, I am going to assume that it is not as efficient as Edge is"	I had no questions. It was extremely easy to do.		"Too many questions if I look at the end time, but I enjoyed the tasks and learned more about the browser by following through."
