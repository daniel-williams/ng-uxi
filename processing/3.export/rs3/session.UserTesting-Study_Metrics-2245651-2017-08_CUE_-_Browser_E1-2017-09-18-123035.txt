Task 83																														
That's it for tasks!  Click on the 'x' in the remote desktop app (near the top of your screen) to close your connection and we'll wrap up with just a few more general questions.																														
																														
																														
Post-Test Questionnaire																														
Question 1																														
"Based on your experience today, how likely are you to recommend this browser to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?"	"0, has the classic stigma attached to it so it's avoided."	0	0	5	"5 - The features I tested were standard and expected, yes they worked perfectly but it does not make the browser stand apart from the crowd, these features only solidify it as a useable browser."	1	I will give it a 8 because I had difficulty getting the tabs into a windows by themself	10	8	7. Just a few issues with it.	10 Very Likely	0	8	5	7	6	"5, it functions just like Chrome, I would recommend Chrome so I may recommend Edge."	7	in terms of usage and i recommand it as 9 or even 10	7	8	5	10	3	10	9	"I has trouble with the remote desktop functions, but the broswer itself was great. I did not have any problems that would prevent me from recommending it to a friend. 10 very likely"	9	"From what i know, Edge browser used to be internet explorer, and it was a very slow browser. But seeing the new version made me realise it's pretty much the same as other browsers. I've been using chrome for the past years, but Edge browser will be one of the top browsers i would recommend from now on. (8)"	8
																														
Question 2																														
Please tell us a bit about how this session went... (too few or too many questions?  too simple or too complex?  etc.)	"Too many questions.Made me feel stupid because of how easy it was.""Doesn't everyone do this all the time? Why are they testing this in 2017?"""	"Far too many questions and tasks, the remote desktop ran very slowly."	"Too many questions because they became very repetetive.  The tasks were easy.  I'm not sure if I was to expect innovation or just for the browser to work properly.  I did not see innovation, but I did see a familiar way to navigate the web...which is totally fine."	"It wasn't too many questions, most of the tasks to me were simple except for the last one which was a little confusing."	The question I thought were far to simple and reaperting.  They were basically the same tasks repeted and therefore only really looked at one aspect of the browser.	"Was pretty simple especially without having to talk aloud as I can act and type quicker without that. At the end, I had a weird error where I could type a new URL into the address bar of my open tab which kept really screwing me up and making me angry so idk if that's a prototype or browser issue. All in all ... idk ... I feel like I'll always end up downloading Chrome or Firefox just because I still deeply distrusted the old IE."	"There were a lot of questions, but this was not complex."	"This session felt longer than I am used to, but the instructions were given extremely well, which made it go very smooth."	I thought overall the questions were the right complexity. I felt that I probably took a bit too long to answer the questions.	The session was easy and straight-forward. Nothing I couldn't figure out how to do. Right amount of questions. Nothing overly complicated. Some things didn't work the way that I expected them to but I was able to trouble-shoot everything to get it to work.	At the begining I thought wow so many questions. How should I do that think loud and answer all the questions but then it was was easy. I liked the length. The Tasks were very easy	way too many questions.	"I prefer thinking out loud to having many questions. Otherwise, it was good."	"It was simple and easy to do, it was interesting and everything was how I expected it to be."	Questions were fine. but the performance of the system as well as browser was not up to the mark. The browser crashed 2 times	too complex	"I feel that the session went well, the number of questions was sufficient.  The delays in the remote desktop probably caused this test to be just over 20 minutes."	"wasnt too bad, not too much"	"there were a lot of questions 86 one and they are repeated, most of them but they were simple to respond to, but they required me a little more time so that i can do the tasks profetionaly and in an understandable way"	"The tasks that were given to me were pretty easy and I executed them very easily without much effort, there was not too many questions"	A few to many questions. The tasks and explanations were relatively simple and easy to follow.	This session was easy to complete. The instructions were very clear and there were not too many tasks to complete.	"The session went well. The questions were repetitive and too similar. The browsers functionality is very similar to what I have used in the past so it was relatively easy for me to use. Other than the fact that the browser crashed at the end and would not let me access the two social media websites to add to my favourites folder, the test went well."	the remote desktop crashes a lot	"To be honest, at first, I was quite alarmed to see that there were 86 steps involved in the test even though the scenario said it would take only 20 minutes to complete. But since it also said that we are not required to talk during the test, I thought it might just be possible to complete in 20 minutes. The fact that it required us not to talk was a bit unusual since UserTesting encourages us to talk non-stop, so it has programmed it's screen recorder that way. If the screen recorder doesn't hear us talk, it gives us a prompt message asking us to talk, and that did make it a little difficult and distracting. But as far as the tasks and questions go, they were quite simple to do. It was easy to tackle all the tasks. It only took so much time because it kept lagging and freezing a bit. Most of the questions were multiple choice questions. Each exercise only required 2 written questions, but it did take a little time to summarise all my thoughts since I wanted to make sure thatI wrote everyhting down as I was not supposed to be talking while doing the exercise. So, I wanted to make sure that I wrote everything I experienced and thought. The test was quite simple, but a bit time-consuming. Thank you! :)"	"The session went fine.  It went longer than the 20 minutes that I expected.  Maybe I'm slower than others.  I did not feel there were to many questions.  It did feel simple, but I use the internet a lot.  So, what is simple for me may not be for others."	The remote desktop was a little wonky but other than that it was ok. I did not feel it was too long	"It was a simple session to complete, even tho I had a hard time with one task. There were several questions, but not too many. Nothing was complex and I was pleasently surprised by the simplicity of the browser, it might be the most user-friendly browser I have ever used."	"As a teenager with a lot of experience on the internet, i think the questions are too simple for me and i would have liked to see other, more complicated features of this browser."	"The session was ok, even if I think that the remote connection, even if easy to setup, was a bottleneck that didn't allow to completely unlock Edge."
