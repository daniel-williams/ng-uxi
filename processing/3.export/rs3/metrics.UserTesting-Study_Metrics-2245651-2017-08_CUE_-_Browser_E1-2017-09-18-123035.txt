"I knew the favorites would be at the top of the webpage where the url was.  Once I saw the star, I knew that would be the favorites.  It took a while to load and I lost connection for a time."	This task was easy to complete.  There was nothing complicated about it.  It seemed like a pretty standard task.	It was a very simple task to do and I was able to find my favorites easily	"It worked the way I wanted it to, the location was where I expected it to be, everything was just easy."	"Was completely straightforward once I knew for sure what the Favorites button/menu was. Had to hover &amp; click to kind of see, but it seemed like it was what I was looking for. Completely standard otherwise."	I gave I did because it was super fast and easy to navigate.	I gave it the high rating simply because of the familiairty. I knew what clicking it would offer without having any prior knowledge of this browser.	"The star icon was easy to understand as being the favorites area, and clicking the icon worked as I thought it would (it brought up a list), and clicking the link took me to the appropriate page"	"It wasn't as simple as I thought it'd be. It took me a few clicks to find where the favorites were. I started with the "". . ."" menus but when it wasn't there, I just diagnosed what the possible solution could be. Of the options, the Star with lines was the obvious choice and that's where it is. Because it's not familiar, it took me a few extra clicks but now I know where it is and it will be much easier in the future."	I do that always privately. The sites I trust and like are the just one click ahead. It makes my work easier	"It was pretty simple; I was able to locate the Favorites section on the first try, so it was obviously intuitive."	Opening my favourite was exactly as I expected. The half star icon let me know what I was dealing with. Everything was straight forward and nothing unexpected came up at all.	"It worked the way that I expected it to, and it was very simple to reach the designated site."	I typically like to only click once to access my favourite web sites. This browser makes me click 2 times which is not extremely intuitive	I know exactly where i have to go	"I associate the star icon with favorites, easily found it and the page loaded quickly."	"It was an easy task to preform, I gave my rating because it isn't something i normally do, but it was easy and fast to figure out."	i gave the rating because i already tried Edge many times and i know how fast/good/easy to navigate and find what i want.	It didn't evolve much effort to find out how to use the Favorite toolbar and it was an overall pleasent experience	Finding favorite sites and opening the site I was supposed to was quite easy. The star and 3 dashes (menu-like button) was quite simple to identify as the favorites menu.	The Favorites list was very easy to find and it didn't take very long to load.	It was easy to find the favourites dropdown menu in the taskbar.	"It works the way it should be. However, Chrome / Firefox has a quick bookmark bar under the url which is very handy."	"Find the 'favourites' button was extremely easy. Even when I hovered over the icon, it clearly said that it was the favourites button. All we had to do after that is simply click on the website we wanted to open. We also had to option to open the website in a new tab. It was also quite easy to spot the button, and the 'star with a list' icon helped in understanding what it must be."	"The star icon is familiar to me from other browsers, so locating the ""Favorites"" icon was easy to find."	I had trouble clicking on the selected items.	"The task was extremely easy to complete, it was very simple and intuitive, this is why i believe it is very well designed and positioned next to the url bar."	"The favorites were easy to find because of the star icon. Once i clicked it, i immediately saw the lasagna recipe website."	"The browser is responsive and opens fast. The GUI is light but it works well. The real is problem was probably the site itself, because it loaded only after many seconds, I restarted the browser thinking it wouldn't load."

Task 22																														
"Please share a bit about your experience with this task, and why you gave the ratings you did."	"Seems new, I havent used something like this before but again that's because I just stick to my favourite bookmarks bar."	It worked just how I expected.  I opened the folder with a group of favorites and right-clicked to open a new tab.  Very easy and familiar.	"Again, this was an easy task.  Nothing innovative.  Just easy."	"It was an easy task to do, however it took some time for the pages to load. Also for some reason when I clicked to another tab, it would still show stuff from the previous tab that I last clicked on."	"Same as opening one favorite link, opening all of them through right clicking in my case, was easy to do and navigate to.  It should be and was a very simple process."	"For one, I NEVER use the Open All Favorites options of any browsers because I never can think of a time where I'd ever need that. Given that, I didn't see the option at first when I thought to right click on the folder but then saw it. Right click is usually the way I'd expect to go for a secondary action like this."	My experience was very easy and it was easy to navigate and to open all the tabs at once.	"I was very impressed by how the favorites drop down did not close after I selected a new tab. my current browser closes my favorites after I open a new tab, and that can be frustrating if i have multiple tabs to open from favorites."	"Opening all favorites in new tabs in Edge was actually easier and cleaner feeling than in Chrome, in my opinion. There were fewer options, which I prefer. It was quicker to make the decision instead of having 3 different options on how to open all the favorites at once"	"I wasn't sure how to get them all in different tabs at first. Once I realized that simply clicking on them would just bring up the new link in the current tab, I realized that I could probably right click on it and move it to a new tab. That worked and now I know how to do that as well."	Opening new sites in diffrent Tabs makes the work much easier than opening them in new Windows	"I used the CTL key while clicking, which is the way I would open new tabs in Chrome, and it worked.  So again, intuitive."	It was great and unexpected that there is an option to open everything at once. I gave the ratings because it was new and very satisfying.	"Reaching the sites through the favorites tab was how I expected it to be, it was simple and easy to do. It was familiar in that the browser I use is essentially the same. Opening multiple tabs is important to me because I need to multitask and it is convenient for me."	I liked the ability to open group of web sites in different tabs at ONCE	It was really fast and easy	"This functions just the way it does on Chrome, it is quick, easy, and familiar."	"i feel like if i didn't right click to open the favorites in a new tab it would've taken me significantly longer to open them each in a new tab, i figure because i already know how to do this it makes the task easier for me then compared to someone who expects to click and have a new tabe come up."	"my experience about opening the favorite folder was good, i found it easy after i saw the ''star'' icon wich is the symbole of bookmarks and favorite in all browsers and then the folder was right there and it was easy to open"	The task was pretty easy to do and very intuitive.	For me finding how to open the favorite sites in new tabs was quite easy and intuitive. What could make it better is if there was an option to open them in new tabs via a button instead of going into the right-click menu.	The folder was easy to find and the links didn't take very long to load.	"Once I figured out that you had to just right click to open in new tab, opening the favourites in their own tabs was easy."	"It works the way similar to IE, very easy to use."	"IT was extremely easy to open all the bookmarks in one click, and it worked exactly as one would expect it to work. It was quite easy to understand and use. It was also very sorted, and had such an arrangement that it also made it quite simple to open even one of the links instead of opening all of them together, if someone wanted to."	"Originally, I was opening each file one at a time.  Then it dawned on me that there was probably an easier way.  Otherwise, opening each one would be monotonous.  That's when I got the idea to right click and see if there were any other options."	I have figured out that for some reason my clicks are opposite of what I am used to. Left click is like a right click and vice versa. I will rate however as if this is normal	"Opening favorites in new tabs was extremely easy to do because it is disigned in a very simple and intuitive way, i believe anybody could do it even if they are use to different web browsers because of it's simplicity and efficiency."	Opening the folder was easy and very similar to other browsers. I opened the pages in new tabs using the middle mouse button and it worked as expected.	"The tabs opened fast. It is easy to switch between them, and I like it. I had no problems in opening multiple favorites in multiple tabs."

Task 32																														
"Please share a bit about your experience with this task, and why you gave the ratings you did."	"That's how you change tabs, nothing new for me."	I only could figure out how to manually change the order of the tabs. I've never needed to reorder my tabs so I found the task unnecessary.  I wish there was a button to change them without doing it manually.	This task was also easy and familiar.  Nothing out of the ordinary.	It was somewhat hard to get the tab to go into the exact spot I wanted it to be in.	"If they did not drag and drop and I was unable to rearrange the tabs as such, I probably wouldn't even use the browser."	"I never thought to look for a one-click button solution for doing something like this, so I went back to my tried-and-true method of manually rearranging them by click and drag. I had one fault where accidentally opened one in a new browser window. I can't imagine needing to have/use a function to auto order all tabs by something like A-Z as I rearrange them mostly on importance or how long I expect to keep them open"	Changing the order was not important to me it was a bit difficult to move them	"The ability to change the order of the tabs is something that is common for any browser that I have used, So I was not too impressed with the ability, it worked as well as I would expect it to."	"The browser kept crashing, and I disliked the opening of a new window that sometimes happened when I was dragging them."	A task as simple as changing the order of the tabs caused the Edge to crash twice and I had to re-open. The good thing is that it kept all of the tabs when I reopened but it shouldn't have crashed by simply rearranging the tabs.	Its Impoirtant the when you do some work that needs to be done in diffrent sites....	"It took too long - not only did it accidentally close the browser, but it was too easy to accidentally pull one of the tabs off the broswer window."	It works the same way in almost every browser.	"It was how I expected it would be, but I was surprised by how dragging the tab would flicker to the tab that I was switching it with."	I experienced speed and relialibility issues while re-arranging the tabs	Hard to find the way and the browser was crashing all the time	"I don't need to change the order of tabs alphabetically, so this is an unimportant feature.  I only could do it manually, I could not find an automated way of doing this."	"i couldn't see the individual tabe because it was blocked by the blue bar, and the bar was acting funny when i clicked the pin"	"again the way to change tabs from Z to A was Familiar because its used probably in every browser, the only problem i faced was the slowdown from the application that make me use another pc, other than that if i used normal Edge the tabs would move faster and smooth, its all about holding and draging the tabs where i want them to be."	It was easy to complete the task but I found It very useless.	"I was expecting there to be an option to easily arrange the tabs. There still could be such an option but I wasn't able to find it. The best solution I could think of is to drag and drop the tabs. However, even that wasn't easy (most probably due to the remote desktop connection which causes a little lag) as the tabs were popping out into separate windows making it even harded."	"I struggled with this one a bit, but once I figured it out it was quite simple."	It works the same as Chrome so it's not easy. The hard part was figuring out the Z-A order.	"it is very easy to use, and straight forward"	"I was expecting to be able to open the tabs in a reverse order by maybe changing some setting, or by being able to find a button to reverse it, but that was not the case. I had to change the order manually, and that took a lot of effort. A little more than I expected, really. It is so because, it froze when I was trying to reverse the tab order, and it also crashed once. It was glitching and lagging a lot. The exercise itself was simply, but the process took too long."	I rearranged the task according to the way I have on other browsers.  The drag and drop method.  It felt familiar.	"I was not sure how to change the order at first, I thought maybe there was a sort setting so I was looking for that. Once I figured out I could drag them in to order it was simple."	"The task was easy to accomplish but I had a small lag problem with the browser, probably due to the remote usage of the PC, anyway the task was very intuitive and simple."	"At first, i was looking for a button to automatically change the tabs order (from Z to A), but as soon as i realised the task was just to change them manually, it was very easy."	It was easy to use the Drag &amp; Drop method to change tabs order.

Task 42																														
"Please share a bit about your experience with this task, and why you gave the ratings you did."	Works exactly the same as Chrome so nothing new.	The new tab kept opening a new window instead of joining my other new window.	This was easy to do.	"It was simple to do, but trying to drag another tab to a new window that I had just created was a little challenging, it kept wanting to go to it's own window."	"It worked as expected but I was a little dissaitisfied with how it handled the tranfer.  Meaning it had to be at a very spceific place to go into the same window and not make another serperate one, instead of just a general area, such as the entire tabs bar."	OMG trying to get that second tab into the same browser took forever and I was literally about to quit and just say No I wasn't successful.  Why didn't it let me place it to the right of my existing tab? Can you only move it to the front of the tab line?	could notmove windows	This is not an option I use frequently. The reason I rated it low is because I did not expect the first new window I created to disapear when I went to grab the second tab. I ended up having to minimize the window so i could do it simultaneously	"It was difficult to get the tab to go into the new window with one other tab, it created a new window instead at first"	Getting the two tabs to line up in one window appears to be a small chore. It worked but not the first time. Have to drag it around a bit to get it to work exactly right. I expect that it should snap into position a little easier than that.	I don't see any needs and it doesn't make sence to me	"It was easy, but I don't like the way the tabs jump around while you're working with them."	"Works the same as other browsers, except you need to be precise with where you are dragging a tab."	I was dissatisfied with drawing the second tab because it only worked if I put it to the left of the previous page.	It worked at expected	Not so user friendly	"It is a neat feature, however it is not something I need to do that often, if ever."	"i should be able to merge them together with my keyboard, i shouldn't have to click right thwen scroll down then try to add. and when i did do that the program created another window and the program dissapeared somewhere now and im going to have to press it again to make it appear again."	"i gave my rating because, first i dont use multiple windows of browser much and second, i already how to do it and yes it was a little easy to use exept that i faild twice to attach the second tab and it opened separatly when i didnt put it at the right place, but when i tried one last time it took place beside the first tab"	"I found that this tool can be very useful, easy to use and can be used for many purposes."	"I was expecting to be able to select multiple tabs by holding Shift or Ctrl , and then draging them out into a new window, but wasn't able to. Also I couldn't find checkboxes on the tabs to allow for multiple tabs selection. I'm currently on a laptop with no mouse attached which perhaps made it harder than it would have been should there was a mouse. The remote desktop connection also causes a little lag, so it's not really clear if that doesn't affect the experience of selecting multiple tabs."	"While it wasn't difficult at all to do, the cursor moved kind of slow when I selected the tabs."	"Again, this works the same as what I am used to with Chrome so it was relatively quick and easy to do."	I cannot do it at all! it crashes	"It worked exactly as I am used to. It did take a few seconds to drop one tab on the otther window, so I was a bit confused as to why it was not sticking together, but eventually, it worked as it should. It did not require any thinking or efforts. I just simply did what it was supposed to do. I was very easy to drag and put the tabs together."	"Apparently, I was dropping the tab in the wrong location.  I was dropping it where I though it should go, which was where the ""+"" is located instead of at the beginning.  Once I realized what I was doing the task was easy."	I did not know how to do this task. I was able to get two tabs in the same window but not three.	"I did not manage to move both tabs and put them back in a single page, but i did manage to move one at a time. I believe it is hard to complete this task, as it is not intuitive"	"Dragging the tabs while holding the mouse button was easy, as expected (similar to other browsers)."	"To create a new windows is easy and straightforward, but I had some problems in moving a tab from a window to another one. I am used to drop the tab anywhere in the upper bar of the target window."

"It was a very simple task to do, I was able to close the tabs with ease."	"I liked that it made sure i did not accidentally close an extra tab, but expected it to do that at the same time."	"Only saying Somewhat Satisfied because I forgot how much I'm used to not being questioned on if I want to close all tabs or not as I've turned that option off on my browser long ago. I know it's a standard question, but it threw me off for a minute and then for some reason I wasn't able to read it clearly at first, unsure of what to instinctively click (maybe the button order was odd? like the Yes/Confirm option was on the left vs right)"	very easy to close.	"I gave it the rating because, this is exactly what I expected to happen when I close a window with multiple tabs. Its a process that is familiar to me"	"The X icon is a really well known icon for closing windows, so it was a very intuitive process."	Closing was easy. I also expected to get a message asking if I was sure I wanted to close both tabs. Easy to execute and happened just as I expected.	Afer finishing work its important to save and close the windows	"I didn't expect it to ask if I wanted to close all the browsers.  I don't get that question in the browser I currently use, and I'd probably find that annoying."	"Works the same way in every single browser, minus the confirmation message"	"It worked the way I expected it to, and it also prompted me if I wanted to close all tabs."	It worked just like i have been used to. Nothing different or new	Same old way and nothing exciting	"I know how to close browser windows, it is nothing new or innovative. I did like the confirmation question before the final close."	it was easy and not complicated task	"every window have one way to be closed and its that big ""X"" mark on the top right corner wich close everything but the good thing about Edge is that it asks me if i want to close that window because it have 2 tabs, so it double check to see if i really want to close the secon tab, and thats nice to be asked about for me."	I think the window should close right away when I click on the top right cross on the browser.	Closing windows on MS Edge is working exactly as expected. I expected to receive a warning that I'm closing multiple tabs and I did. I also expected there to be an option to remember my choice and not show this warning again and there it was. Overall it's working perfectly fine for my understanding.	Closing the window with two tabs was very easy and quick.	The prompt that comes up when you hit the close button on the top right is nice because I sometimes find myself closing tabs or windows that I don't want to or accidentaly close. It works the same as my other browsers so it is quick and easy.	"I cannot open new tab, so I cannot perform the closing task"	"IT was very easy to close the windows. We coud either do that through the task bar (like I did), or we could easy open the browser with two tabs and click on the cross icon on the top right. I really loved the fact that it gave me a prompt message to make sure that I wanted to close all the tabs on that browser. I think that is very useful, and will help a lot. It will also help avoid closing a tab by mistake."	It felt familiar.  It worked the same way that other browsers do.	"Easy, it worked as I am used to."	"It is an extremely easy task to complete, anyone could do it. The browsing experience required is minimal and it is very intuitive"	"Closing a window by pressing the X button, like any other window."	"Closing a windows has been pretty easy. I really like that you can close the window with or without asking for confirmation (thanks to the checkbox ""Always close all tabs"")"

Task 72																														
"Please share a bit about your experience with this task, and why you gave the ratings you did."	N/A	The star symbol was familiar and a drop down window was beneficial.	Most browsers operate in a similar way.  So this was an easy task.	"It was simple to add a website to favorites, I had no issues with adding them."	"I liked the appearence of the star and its location more than other browsers, therefore a little happier than expected."	"My main concern before clicking the Star, which I _assumed_ was the Favorites button, but wasn't 100% and didn't see any tooltip lable, was that I wouldn't know where in the Favorites tree that it may be stored. Luckily upon finally clicking it, it gave me the option of where I wanted to save it."	all i hadto was click star and then add.	I was Satisfied with how I knew exactly what to do in order to add a site to my favorites. I knew this because it is exactly how I add favorites on my favorite browser.	"I loved that I could use Ctrl + D to add a site to my favorites, just like I do with Chrome"	"Knowing that the favorites hub is the star with three lines, I expected before that the star was the method to add to the favorites; however, I also expected (just like with the favorites hub) that once I hovered over the star that it would give me a small pop-up saying ""add to favorites"" but it didn't happen so it was a little trial and error to get it to work."	Sites that I visit a few times daily or weekly are just with one click available tro me	It was easy.	Works the same as chrome browser. The star lets me know that I can favourite the site.	"It was familiar to me, adding a site to favorites was how I expected it would work and it was easy to do."	It works like chrome so i felt nothing new	Traditional way	The ability to add a site as a favorite functioned the same as it does in Chrome.	i was familiar with adding websites to the favites	"i used multiple browsers in my life and they all have the same ""favorite icon'', and all of them either have it far away and small or hiden in someplace, exept that Edge have it big and clear to acces and was easy to make ""youtube"" as a favorite"	I taught that It would be as simple as clicking a button and that's It but I had confim some things and overall took longer than I expected.	I found adding a site to my favorites list really easy. Also the pop-up menu seems very modern and clear to my taste. It allows for renaming of the site in the favorites list and also to select in which list to add it straight from the menu which is great. I loved this experience.	Adding a website to my Favorites was a quick and easy process.	"Again, this works almost identical to Chrome, which is very familiar, which makes it very quick and easy to do."	it works in the way it should	"It was easy to add the site to my Favourites since the star icon was clearly visible and it was also located where I expected it to be. Then the box that appeared was very inspiring and easy to process. The presentation was extremely beautiful and modern. It was very visually appealing. I liked how simple it was to use. The colors and icons used in the box were also quite nice to look at, and it also made the process a lot simpler to understand since everything was highlighted and distinct from one another. So, every aspect of it had been given a lot of focus."	"Again, it was the same process that I use in other browsers so it was easy to use."	worked just as i expected	"The steps needed to complete this task are the same as many other browsers, so I believe it is intuitive and easy to do for any person, no mater what experince they have on the internet"	When i saw the star button i realised this is how you add sites to favorites.	"The ""star"" symbol makes it really easy to add a Favorite site. The browser asks for the name before saving, so you don't have to rename it later, from the favorite menu."

Task 82																														
"Please share a bit about your experience with this task, and why you gave the ratings you did."	"Seems easy enough, but I wouldn't use it."	The web page froze for over 2 minutes and I could add a favorite to the folder I created.	No complaints.  Easy task to complete...familiar.	"It was somewhat complicated to add a new folder, I did not see anything that resemeled a new folder, I just figured to right click and that was when I was given the option. After adding the folder it was simple to add websites to that folder but for some reason when I tried typing into the browser it did not want to let me write the website."	It was easy but as the other tasts it was expected.	"I've never quite thought about populating a new folder specifically with a list of sites, so this task threw me off some. Usually I'll find a site first and THEN I'll decide if I want to add it to a folder, so I usually am already on a site and trying to add it as a favorite before I create a folder ... which I could have more easily done from the Add Favorites prompt.  One note though... I keep getting tripped up on these call to action buttons being on the left instead of on the right.  Idk why, as maybe that's standard. But somethign about it keeps making me want to click Cancel or whatever it is on the right. I have to kind of stop and read the buttons this way."	It was a bit complicated because the browser froze for a few.	"I was only disatisfied because when I clicked create a folder it did not let me automatically type in the name of the folder, instead I had to write click it and click rename."	I thought it would be nice if I could just create new bookmarks based on the url instead of needing to navigate to the url and bookmark it	"The process is easy and should have been much easier than it actually was. After I created the folder and added instagram to the folder. I tried to navigate to linkedin; however, when I clicked on the address bar and began typing, it wouldn't accept any new input from keyboard. Had to create a new tab and go from there. Very frustrating."	If you have so may sites your working with its the important that they are organised and sorted in Folders	"When I attempted to add the instagram one, for some reason, the browser address bar wouldn't accept any input from my keyboard.  I'm typing this, so obviously nothing is wrong with my keyboard."	Faster than my experience in other browser. Nice to have a favourites menu to quickly take care of everything.	"It was familiar as usual, easy to do, worked the way as expected and it looked nice and clean."	Not happy with the performance of the browser in general	Browser is dead slow and crashing	"I was expecting an ""add folder"" button instead of having to right click to add a new folder."	"i was able to complete the task easy, but i thought i could create a new folder when i went to the favorites tab first, which wasn't the case. i have to be adding it to the favorites before i could create a new folder, which is okay i guess."	"making the 2 websites as favorite was easy and also making a new folder was easy too by just right clicking and creating a new folder, and finaly just switching the location of the favorites when makeing the websites and favorite was simple and easy to us too"	It took a little bit of thinking but once I understood It It was easy.	"Adding a new folder in the favorites list was overall very easy. It is in line with the Windows ecosystem with the right-click menu allowing you to create a new folder. Any Widows user should be able to create a new folder in the Favorites list quite natural. I would have liked there to be an option to add the two sites directly from the Social Media folder, instead of having to open the sites first. However, it was still really easy and intuitive to add them once the folder was created."	This was yet another simple and quick task to complete.	"I know I would be able to add the folder and add the favourites to the folder, but Edge crashed out and I was unable to complete the task."	I crashes often and cannot perform the task smoothly	"It was very easy to add the websites to my favourites and to simply create a new folder under favourites, simultaneously. We just had to bookmark a site and save it under a new folder. After that, fo the second bookmark, we simply had to select the folder we created. It worked exactly as I thought it would."	"It took me a minute to create a new folder.  Possibly adding that function on the ""Favorites"" bar would be helpful.  I did it by right clicking, because I started at the ""Favorites"" bar.  If I had started by going to the site and clicking on the star it would have been easier."	"It took me a minute because I was unable to type anything in the browser bar, do not know why, but the process of adding the sites to th efolder was very easy"	"This process is a little bit harder for people who never used a browser, but for anyone with basic to advanced experience  it is easyer to do than in many other browsers. I believe it is very intuitive and easy"	"""New Folder"" feature worked the way i expected."	I liked the way you create folders and add favorite sites to it. I would add anyway a button to make folder creation simpler. It's not automatic for everyone to think about the right mouse button.
