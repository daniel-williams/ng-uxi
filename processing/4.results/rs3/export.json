But since it also said that we are not required to talk during the test, I thought it might just be possible to complete in 20 minutes. The fact that it required us not to talk was a bit unusual since UserTesting encourages us to talk non-stop, so it has programmed it's screen recorder that way. If the screen recorder doesn't hear us talk, it gives us a prompt message asking us to talk, and that did make it a little difficult and distracting. But as far as the tasks and questions go, they were quite simple to do. It was easy to tackle all the tasks. It only took so much time because it kept lagging and freezing a bit. Most of the questions were multiple choice questions. Each exercise only required 2 written questions, but it did take a little time to summarise all my thoughts since I wanted to make sure thatI wrote everyhting down as I was not supposed to be talking while doing the exercise. So, I wanted to make sure that I wrote everything I experienced and thought. The test was quite simple, but a bit time-consuming. Thank you! :)",
